He believes the Malbec from Altura Maxima Vineyard is the embodiment of two extremes - a traditional grape variety from his French origins made from the vineyard that challenges all convention in the modern viticultural world.'} score: 0.6179681398386916\n",
      "{'name': 'Catena Zapata Nicasia Vineyard Malbec 2004', 'region': 'Argentina', 'variety': 'Red Wine', 'rating': 96.0, 'notes': '\"The single-vineyard 2004 Malbec Nicasia Vineyard is located in the Altamira district of Mendoza. It was aged for 18 months in new French oak. Opaque purple-colored, it exhibits a complex perfume of pain grille, scorched earth, mineral, licorice, blueberry, and black cherry. Thick on the palate, bordering on opulent, it has layers of fruit, silky tannins, and a long, fruit-filled finish. It will age effortlessly for another 6-8 years and provide pleasure through 2025. When all is said and done, Catena Zapata is the Argentina winery of reference â€“ the standard of excellence for comparing all others. The brilliant, forward-thinking Nicolas Catena remains in charge, with his daughter, Laura, playing an increasingly large role. The Catena Zapata winery is an essential destination for fans of both architecture and wine in Mendoza. It is hard to believe, given the surge in popularity of Malbec in recent years, that Catena Zapata only began exporting Malbec to the United States in 1994.\"'} score: 0.6112811927021986\n",

Notes of spices and minerality make a complex nose. On the palate, a supple entry, dark berries and spices. A very structured and quite wild Malbec, with firm fine-grain tannins, showing its calcareous foundations and columns. The mouth feel is full of thrilling freshness and balance, with a long and persistent finish.'} score: 0.6056132152581988\n",
